## Introduction

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

In the field of computer vision, researchers have repeatedly shown the value of
transfer learning â€” pretraining a neural network model on a known task/dataset, for
instance ImageNet classification, and then performing fine-tuning â€” using the trained neural
network as the basis of a new specific-purpose model. In recent years, researchers
have shown that a similar technique can be useful in many natural language tasks.

BERT makes use of Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations
between words (or subwords) in a text. In its vanilla form, Transformer includes two
separate mechanisms â€” an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces
a prediction for the task. Since BERTâ€™s goal is to generate a language model, only the
encoder mechanism is necessary. The detailed workings of Transformer are described in
a paper by Google.

As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially
(left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer encoder reads the entire
sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though
it would be more accurate to say that itâ€™s non-directional. This characteristic
allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings
(left and right of the word).

When training language models, a challenge is defining a prediction goal.
Many models predict the next word in a sequence (e.g. `"The child came home from _"`),
a directional approach which inherently limits context learning. To overcome this
challenge, BERT uses two training strategies:

### Masked Language Modeling (MLM)

Before feeding word sequences into BERT, 15% of the words in each sequence are replaced
with a `[MASK]` token. The model then attempts to predict the original value of the masked
words, based on the context provided by the other, non-masked, words in the sequence.

### Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)

In the BERT training process, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to
predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original
document. During training, 50% of the inputs are a pair in which the second sentence is the
subsequent sentence in the original document, while in the other 50% a random sentence
from the corpus is chosen as the second sentence. The assumption is that the random sentence
will represent a disconnect from the first sentence.

Though Google provides a pretrained BERT checkpoint for English, you may often need
to either pretrain the model from scratch for a different language, or do a
continued-pretraining to fit the model to a new domain. In this notebook, we pretrain
BERT from scratch optimizing both MLM and NSP objectves using ðŸ¤— Transformers on the `WikiText`
English dataset loaded from ðŸ¤— Datasets.

## Load the WikiText dataset

"""
We now download the `WikiText` language modeling dataset. It is a collection of over
100 million tokens extracted from the set of verified "Good" and "Featured" articles on
Wikipedia.

We load the dataset from [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets).
For the purpose of demonstration in this notebook, we work with only the `train`
split of the dataset. This can be easily done with the `load_dataset` function.
"""

from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("wikitext", "wikitext-2-raw-v1")

"""
The dataset just has one column which is the raw text, and this is all we need for
pretraining BERT!
"""

print(dataset)

"""
## Training a new Tokenizer
"""

"""
First we train our own tokenizer from scratch on our corpus, so that can we
can use it to train our language model from scratch.

But why would you need to train a tokenizer? That's because Transformer models very
often use subword tokenization algorithms, and they need to be trained to identify the
parts of words that are often present in the corpus you are using.

The ðŸ¤— Transformers `Tokenizer` (as the name indicates) will tokenize the inputs
(including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary)
and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model
requires.

First we make a list of all the raw documents from the `WikiText` corpus:
"""

all_texts = [
    doc for doc in dataset["train"]["text"] if len(doc) > 0 and not doc.startswith(" =")
]

"""
Next we make a `batch_iterator` function that will aid us to train our tokenizer.
"""


def batch_iterator():
    for i in range(0, len(all_texts), TOKENIZER_BATCH_SIZE):
        yield all_texts[i : i + TOKENIZER_BATCH_SIZE]


"""
In this notebook, we train a tokenizer with the exact same algorithms and
parameters as an existing one. For instance, we train a new version of the
`BERT-CASED` tokenzier on `Wikitext-2` using the same tokenization algorithm.

First we need to load the tokenizer we want to use as a model:
"""

from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_CHECKPOINT)

"""
Now we train our tokenizer using the entire `train` split of the `Wikitext-2`
dataset.
"""

tokenizer = tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(
    batch_iterator(), vocab_size=TOKENIZER_VOCABULARY
)

"""
So now we our done training our new tokenizer! Next we move on to the data
pre-processing steps.
"""

"""
## Data Pre-processing
"""

"""
For the sake of demonstrating the workflow, in this notebook we only take
small subsets of the entire WikiText `train` and `test` splits.
"""

dataset["train"] = dataset["train"].select([i for i in range(1000)])
dataset["validation"] = dataset["validation"].select([i for i in range(1000)])

"""
Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to pre-process them and get them
ready for the task. As mentioned earlier, the BERT pretraining task includes two tasks
in total, the `NSP` task and the `MLM` task. ðŸ¤— Transformers have an easy to implement
`collator` called the `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`. However, we need to get the
data ready for `NSP` manually.

Next we write a simple function called the `prepare_train_features` that helps us in
the pre-processing and is compatible with ðŸ¤— Datasets. To summarize, our pre-processing
function should:

- Get the dataset ready for the NSP task by creating pairs of sentences (A,B), where B
either actually follows A, or B is randomly sampled from somewhere else in the corpus.
It should also generate a corresponding label for each pair, which is 1 if B actually
follows A and 0 if not.
- Tokenize the text dataset into it's corresponding token ids that will be used for
embedding look-up in BERT
- Create additional inputs for the model like `token_type_ids`, `attention_mask`, etc.

yourself, make sure the [MASK] token is among the special tokens you passed during training!

To get the data ready for MLM, we simply use the `collator` called the
`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` provided by the ðŸ¤— Transformers library on our dataset

to define the exact config defined in the original BERT paper.

We can easily achieve this using the `BertConfig` class from the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.
The `from_pretrained()` method expects the name of a model. Here we define the simplest
model with which we also trained our model, i.e., `bert-base-cased`.

unpacking our inputs and calculating the loss. So we need not do anything ourselves except
defining the model with the correct `config` we want!

Our model has now been trained! We suggest to please train the model on the complete
dataset for atleast 50 epochs for decent performance. The pretrained model now acts as
a language model and is meant to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. Thus it can now be
fine-tuned on any downstream task like Question Answering, Text Classification
etc.!
"""

"""
Now you can push this model to ðŸ¤— Model Hub and also share it with with all your friends,
family, favorite pets: they can all load it with the identifier
`"your-username/the-name-you-picked"` so for instance:

```python
model.push_to_hub("pretrained-bert", organization="keras-io")
tokenizer.push_to_hub("pretrained-bert", organization="keras-io")

And after you push your model this is how you can load it in the future!

```python
from transformers import TFBertForPreTraining

model = TFBertForPreTraining.from_pretrained("your-username/my-awesome-model")

or, since it's a pretrained model and you would generally use it for fine-tuning
on a downstream task, you can also load it for some other task like:

```python
from transformers import TFBertForSequenceClassification

model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("your-username/my-awesome-model")

with the transformer layers. A new task-specific head will be added with random weights.
