Description: A model that learns to add strings of numbers, e.g. "535+61" -> "596".
Accelerator: GPU
"""
"""
## Introduction

In this example, we train a model to learn to add two numbers, provided as strings.

**Example:**

- Input: "535+61"
- Output: "596"

Input may optionally be reversed, which was shown to increase performance in many tasks
 in: [Learning to Execute](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4615) and
[Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf).

Theoretically, sequence order inversion introduces shorter term dependencies between
 source and target for this problem.

**Results:**

For two digits (reversed):

+ One layer LSTM (128 HN), 5k training examples = 99% train/test accuracy in 55 epochs

Three digits (reversed):

+ One layer LSTM (128 HN), 50k training examples = 99% train/test accuracy in 100 epochs

Four digits (reversed):

+ One layer LSTM (128 HN), 400k training examples = 99% train/test accuracy in 20 epochs

Five digits (reversed):

+ One layer LSTM (128 HN), 550k training examples = 99% train/test accuracy in 30 epochs
