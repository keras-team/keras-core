Description: Implementing the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification.
Accelerator: GPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

This example implements the [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)
model by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. for image classification,
and demonstrates it on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
The ViT model applies the Transformer architecture with self-attention to sequences of
image patches, without using convolution layers.

## Build the ViT model

The ViT model consists of multiple Transformer blocks,
which use the `layers.MultiHeadAttention` layer as a self-attention mechanism
applied to the sequence of patches. The Transformer blocks produce a
`[batch_size, num_patches, projection_dim]` tensor, which is processed via an
classifier head with softmax to produce the final class probabilities output.

Unlike the technique described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929),
which prepends a learnable embedding to the sequence of encoded patches to serve
as the image representation, all the outputs of the final Transformer block are
reshaped with `layers.Flatten()` and used as the image
representation input to the classifier head.
Note that the `layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer
could also be used instead to aggregate the outputs of the Transformer block,
especially when the number of patches and the projection dimensions are large.

"""
After 100 epochs, the ViT model achieves around 55% accuracy and
82% top-5 accuracy on the test data. These are not competitive results on the CIFAR-100 dataset,
as a ResNet50V2 trained from scratch on the same data can achieve 67% accuracy.

Note that the state of the art results reported in the
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) are achieved by pre-training the ViT model using
the JFT-300M dataset, then fine-tuning it on the target dataset. To improve the model quality
without pre-training, you can try to train the model for more epochs, use a larger number of
Transformer layers, resize the input images, change the patch size, or increase the projection dimensions. 
Besides, as mentioned in the paper, the quality of the model is affected not only by architecture choices, 
but also by parameters such as the learning rate schedule, optimizer, weight decay, etc.
In practice, it's recommended to fine-tune a ViT model
that was pre-trained using a large, high-resolution dataset.
