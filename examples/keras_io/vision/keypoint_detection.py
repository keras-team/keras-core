Description: Training a keypoint detector with data augmentation and transfer learning.
Accelerator: GPU
"""
"""
Keypoint detection consists of locating key object parts. For example, the key parts
of our faces include nose tips, eyebrows, eye corners, and so on. These parts help to
represent the underlying object in a feature-rich manner. Keypoint detection has
applications that include pose estimation, face detection, etc.

In this example, we will build a keypoint detector using the
[StanfordExtra dataset](https://github.com/benjiebob/StanfordExtra),
using transfer learning. This example requires TensorFlow 2.4 or higher,
as well as [`imgaug`](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/) library,
which can be installed using the following command:
"""

"""shell
pip install -q -U imgaug
"""

"""
## Data collection
"""

"""
The StanfordExtra dataset contains 12,000 images of dogs together with keypoints and
segmentation maps. It is developed from the [Stanford dogs dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
It can be downloaded with the command below:
"""

"""shell
wget -q http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/images.tar
"""

"""
Annotations are provided as a single JSON file in the StanfordExtra dataset and one needs
to fill [this form](https://forms.gle/sRtbicgxsWvRtRmUA) to get access to it. The
authors explicitly instruct users not to share the JSON file, and this example respects this wish:
you should obtain the JSON file yourself.

The JSON file is expected to be locally available as `stanfordextra_v12.zip`.

After the files are downloaded, we can extract the archives.
"""

"""shell
tar xf images.tar
unzip -qq ~/stanfordextra_v12.zip

In this example, the keys we are interested in are:

There are a total of 24 entries present inside `joints`. Each entry has 3 values:

* x-coordinate
* y-coordinate
* visibility flag of the keypoints (1 indicates visibility and 0 indicates non-visibility)

As we can see `joints` contain multiple `[0, 0, 0]` entries which denote that those
keypoints were not labeled. In this example, we will consider both non-visible as well as
unlabeled keypoints in order to allow mini-batch learning.

"""
The plots show that we have images of non-uniform sizes, which is expected in most
real-world scenarios. However, if we resize these images to have a uniform shape (for
instance (224 x 224)) their ground-truth annotations will also be affected. The same
applies if we apply any geometric transformation (horizontal flip, for e.g.) to an image.
Fortunately, `imgaug` provides utilities that can handle this issue.
In the next section, we will write a data generator inheriting the
[`keras.utils.Sequence`](https://keras.io/api/utils/python_utils/#sequence-class) class
that applies data augmentation on batches of data using `imgaug`.
