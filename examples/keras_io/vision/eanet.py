## Introduction

This example implements the [EANet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02358)
model for image classification, and demonstrates it on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
EANet introduces a novel attention mechanism
named ***external attention***, based on two external, small, learnable, and
shared memories, which can be implemented easily by simply using two cascaded
linear layers and two normalization layers. It conveniently replaces self-attention
as used in existing architectures. External attention has linear complexity, as it only
implicitly considers the correlations between all samples.

## Implement the EANet model
"""

"""
The EANet model leverages external attention.
The computational complexity of traditional self attention is `O(d * N ** 2)`,
where `d` is the embedding size, and `N` is the number of patch.
the authors find that most pixels are closely related to just a few other
pixels, and an `N`-to-`N` attention matrix may be redundant.
So, they propose as an alternative an external
attention module where the computational complexity of external attention is `O(d * S * N)`.
As `d` and `S` are hyper-parameters,
the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of pixels. In fact, this is equivalent
to a drop patch operation, because a lot of information contained in a patch
in an image is redundant and unimportant.

EANet just replaces self attention in Vit with external attention.
The traditional Vit achieved a ~73% test top-5 accuracy and ~41 top-1 accuracy after
training 50 epochs, but with 0.6M parameters. Under the same experimental environment
and the same hyperparameters, The EANet model we just trained has just 0.3M parameters,
and it gets us to ~73% test top-5 accuracy and ~43% top-1 accuracy. This fully demonstrates the
effectiveness of external attention.

We only show the training
process of EANet, you can train Vit under the same experimental conditions and observe
the test results.
