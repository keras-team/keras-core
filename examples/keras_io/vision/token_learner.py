## Introduction

Vision Transformers ([Dosovitskiy et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)) and many
other Transformer-based architectures ([Liu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030),
[Yuan et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11986), etc.) have shown strong results in
image recognition. The following provides a brief overview of the components involved in the
Vision Transformer architecture for image classification:

* Extract small patches from input images.
* Linearly project those patches.
* Add positional embeddings to these linear projections.
* Run these projections through a series of Transformer ([Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))
blocks.
* Finally, take the representation from the final Transformer block and add a
classification head.

If we take 224x224 images and extract 16x16 patches, we get a total of 196 patches (also
called tokens) for each image. The number of patches increases as we increase the
resolution, leading to higher memory footprint. Could we use a reduced
number of patches without having to compromise performance?
Ryoo et al. investigate this question in
[TokenLearner: Adaptive Space-Time Tokenization for Videos](https://openreview.net/forum?id=z-l1kpDXs88).
They introduce a novel module called **TokenLearner** that can help reduce the number
of patches used by a Vision Transformer (ViT) in an adaptive manner. With TokenLearner
incorporated in the standard ViT architecture, they are able to reduce the amount of
compute (measured in FLOPS) used by the model.

In this example, we implement the TokenLearner module and demonstrate its
performance with a mini ViT and the CIFAR-10 dataset. We make use of the following
references:

* [Official TokenLearner code](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/blob/main/scenic/projects/token_learner/model.py)
* [Image Classification with ViTs on keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/)

feature order.

## TokenLearner module

The following figure presents a pictorial overview of the module
([source](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/improving-vision-transformer-efficiency.html)).

The TokenLearner module takes as input an image-shaped tensor. It then passes it through
multiple single-channel convolutional layers extracting different spatial attention maps
focusing on different parts of the input. These attention maps are then element-wise
multiplied to the input and result is aggregated with pooling. This pooled output can be
trated as a summary of the input and has much lesser number of patches (8, for example)
than the original one (196, for example).

Using multiple convolution layers helps with expressivity. Imposing a form of spatial
attention helps retain relevant information from the inputs. Both of these components are
crucial to make TokenLearner work, especially when we are significantly reducing the number of patches.

## Results

We experimented with and without the TokenLearner inside the mini ViT we implemented
(with the same hyperparameters presented in this example). Here are our results:

| **TokenLearner** | **# tokens in<br> TokenLearner** | **Top-1 Acc<br>(Averaged across 5 runs)** | **GFLOPs** | **TensorBoard** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

| N | - (# Transformer layers: 8) | 55.36% | 0.0359 | [Link](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/sepBK5zNSaOtdCeEG6SV9w/) |

TokenLearner is able to consistently outperform our mini ViT without the module. It is
also interesting to notice that it was also able to outperform a deeper version of our
mini ViT (with 8 layers). The authors also report similar observations in the paper and
they attribute this to the adaptiveness of TokenLearner.

One should also note that the FLOPs count **decreases** considerably with the addition of
the TokenLearner module. With less FLOPs count the TokenLearner module is able to
deliver better results. This aligns very well with the authors' findings.

Additionally, the authors [introduced](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/blob/main/scenic/projects/token_learner/model.py#L104)
a newer version of the TokenLearner for smaller training data regimes. Quoting the authors:

> Instead of using 4 conv. layers with small channels to implement spatial attention,
  this version uses 2 grouped conv. layers with more channels. It also uses softmax
  instead of sigmoid. We confirmed that this version works better when having limited
  training data, such as training with ImageNet1K from scratch.

We experimented with this module and in the following table we summarize the results:

| **# Groups** | **# Tokens** | **Top-1 Acc** | **GFLOPs** | **TensorBoard** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

| 4 | 8 | 55.196% | 0.0149 | [Link](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/WUkrHbZASdu3zrfmY4ETZg/) |

Please note that we used the same hyperparameters presented in this example. Our
implementation is available
[in this notebook](https://github.com/ariG23498/TokenLearner/blob/master/TokenLearner-V1.1.ipynb).
We acknowledge that the results with this new TokenLearner module are slightly off
than expected and this might mitigate with hyperparameter tuning.

*Note*: To compute the FLOPs of our models we used
[this utility](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001/regnety/blob/main/regnety/utils/model_utils.py#L27)
from [this repository](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001/regnety).

## Number of parameters

You may have noticed that adding the TokenLearner module increases the number of
parameters of the base network. But that does not mean it is less efficient as shown by
[Dehghani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12894). Similar findings were reported
by [Bello et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07579) as well. The TokenLearner module
helps reducing the FLOPS in the overall network thereby helping to reduce the memory
footprint.
"""

"""
## Final notes

* TokenFuser: The authors of the paper also propose another module named TokenFuser. This
module helps in remapping the representation of the TokenLearner output back to its
original spatial resolution. To reuse the TokenLearner in the ViT architecture, the
TokenFuser is a must. We first learn the tokens from the TokenLearner, build a
representation of the tokens from a Transformer layer and then remap the representation
into the original spatial resolution, so that it can again be consumed by a TokenLearner.
Note here that you can only use the TokenLearner module once in entire ViT model if not
paired with the TokenFuser.
* Use of these modules for video: The authors also suggest that TokenFuser goes really
well with Vision Transformers for Videos ([Arnab et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15691)).
