## Introduction

This example shows how to forecast traffic condition using graph neural networks and LSTM.
Specifically, we are interested in predicting the future values of the traffic speed given
a history of the traffic speed for a collection of road segments.

One popular method to
solve this problem is to consider each road segment's traffic speed as a separate
timeseries and predict the future values of each timeseries
using the past values of the same timeseries.

This method, however, ignores the dependency of the traffic speed of one road segment on
the neighboring segments. To be able to take into account the complex interactions between
the traffic speed on a collection of neighboring roads, we can define the traffic network
as a graph and consider the traffic speed as a signal on this graph. In this example,
we implement a neural network architecture which can process timeseries data over a graph.
We first show how to process the data and create a
[tf.data.Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset) for
forecasting over graphs. Then, we implement a model which uses graph convolution and
LSTM layers to perform forecasting over a graph.

The data processing and the model architecture are inspired by this paper:

a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting." Proceedings of the 27th International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

### Data description

We use a real-world traffic speed dataset named `PeMSD7`. We use the version
collected and prepared by [Yu et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875)
and available
[here](https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18/tree/master/dataset).

The data consists of two files:

- `PeMSD7_W_228.csv` contains the distances between 228
stations across the District 7 of California.
- `PeMSD7_V_228.csv` contains traffic
speed collected for those stations in the weekdays of May and June of 2012.

The full description of the dataset can be found in
[Yu et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875).

### sub-sampling roads

To reduce the problem size and make the training faster, we will only
work with a sample of 26 roads out of the 228 roads in the dataset.
We have chosen the roads by starting from road 0, choosing the 5 closest
roads to it, and continuing this process until we get 25 roads. You can choose
any other subset of the roads. We chose the roads in this way to increase the likelihood
of having roads with correlated speed timeseries.
`sample_routes` contains the IDs of the selected roads.

### Creating TensorFlow Datasets

Next, we create the datasets for our forecasting problem. The forecasting problem
can be stated as follows: given a sequence of the
road speed values at times `t+1, t+2, ..., t+T`, we want to predict the future values of
the roads speed for times `t+T+1, ..., t+T+h`. So for each time `t` the inputs to our
model are `T` vectors each of size `N` and the targets are `h` vectors each of size `N`,
where `N` is the number of roads.
"""

"""
We use the Keras built-in function
[`timeseries_dataset_from_array()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/timeseries_dataset_from_array).
The function `create_tf_dataset()` below takes as input a `numpy.ndarray` and returns a
`tf.data.Dataset`. In this function `input_sequence_length=T` and `forecast_horizon=h`.

The argument `multi_horizon` needs more explanation. Assume `forecast_horizon=3`.
If `multi_horizon=True` then the model will make a forecast for time steps
`t+T+1, t+T+2, t+T+3`. So the target will have shape `(T,3)`. But if
`multi_horizon=False`, the model will make a forecast only for time step `t+T+3` and
so the target will have shape `(T, 1)`.

You may notice that the input tensor in each batch has shape
`(batch_size, input_sequence_length, num_routes, 1)`. The last dimension is added to
make the model more general: at each time step, the input features for each raod may
contain multiple timeseries. For instance, one might want to use temperature timeseries
in addition to historical values of the speed as input features. In this example,
however, the last dimension of the input is always 1.

We use the last 12 values of the speed in each road to forecast the speed for 3 time
steps ahead:

### Roads Graph

As mentioned before, we assume that the road segments form a graph.
The `PeMSD7` dataset has the road segments distance. The next step
is to create the graph adjacency matrix from these distances. Following
[Yu et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) (equation 10) we assume there
is an edge between two nodes in the graph if the distance between the corresponding roads
is less than a threshold.

but in our example the input to the layer is a 4D tensor of shape
`(num_nodes, batch_size, input_seq_length, in_feat)`. The graph convolution layer
performs the following steps:

- The nodes' representations are computed in `self.compute_nodes_representation()`
by multiplying the input features by `self.weight`
- The aggregated neighbors' messages are computed in `self.compute_aggregated_messages()`
by first aggregating the neighbors' representations and then multiplying the results by
`self.weight`
- The final output of the layer is computed in `self.update()` by combining the nodes
representations and the neighbors' aggregated messages

Of course, the goal here is to demonstrate the method,
not to achieve the best performance. To improve the
model's accuracy, all model hyperparameters should be tuned carefully. In addition,
several of the `LSTMGC` blocks can be stacked to increase the representation power
of the model.
