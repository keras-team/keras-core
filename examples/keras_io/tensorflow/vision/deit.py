## Introduction

In the original *Vision Transformers* (ViT) paper
([Dosovitskiy et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)),
the authors concluded that to perform on par with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
ViTs need to be pre-trained on larger datasets. The larger the better. This is mainly
due to the lack of inductive biases in the ViT architecture -- unlike CNNs,
they don't have layers that exploit locality. In a follow-up paper
([Steiner et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10270)),
the authors show that it is possible to substantially improve the performance of ViTs
with stronger regularization and longer training.

Many groups have proposed different ways to deal with the problem
of data-intensiveness of ViT training.
One such way was shown in the *Data-efficient image Transformers*,
(DeiT) paper ([Touvron et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877)). The
authors introduced a distillation technique that is specific to transformer-based vision
models. DeiT is among the first works to show that it's possible to train ViTs well
without using larger datasets.

In this example, we implement the distillation recipe proposed in DeiT. This
requires us to slightly tweak the original ViT architecture and write a custom training
loop to implement the distillation recipe.

To comfortably navigate through this example, you'll be expected to know how a ViT and
knowledge distillation work. The following are good resources in case you needed a
refresher:

## Notes

* Through the use of distillation, we're effectively transferring the inductive biases of
a CNN-based teacher model.
* Interestingly enough, this distillation strategy works better with a CNN as the teacher
model rather than a Transformer as shown in the paper.
* The use of regularization to train DeiT models is very important.
* ViT models are initialized with a combination of different initializers including
truncated normal, random normal, Glorot uniform, etc. If you're looking for
end-to-end reproduction of the original results, don't forget to initialize the ViTs well.
* If you want to explore the pre-trained DeiT models in TensorFlow and Keras with code
for fine-tuning, [check out these models on TF-Hub](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/collections/deit/1).
