Description: Compact Convolutional Transformers for efficient image classification.
Accelerator: GPU
"""
"""
As discussed in the [Vision Transformers (ViT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) paper,
a Transformer-based architecture for vision typically requires a larger dataset than
usual, as well as a longer pre-training schedule. [ImageNet-1k](http://imagenet.org/)
(which has about a million images) is considered to fall under the medium-sized data regime with
respect to ViTs. This is primarily because, unlike CNNs, ViTs (or a typical
Transformer-based architecture) do not have well-informed inductive biases (such as
convolutions for processing images). This begs the question: can't we combine the
benefits of convolution and the benefits of Transformers
in a single network architecture? These benefits include parameter-efficiency, and
self-attention to process long-range and global dependencies (interactions between
different regions in an image).

In [Escaping the Big Data Paradigm with Compact Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704),
Hassani et al. present an approach for doing exactly this. They proposed the
**Compact Convolutional Transformer** (CCT) architecture. In this example, we will work on an
implementation of CCT and we will see how well it performs on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of self-attention or Transformers, you can read
[this chapter](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition/chapter-11/r-3/312)
from  Fran√ßois Chollet's book *Deep Learning with Python*. This example uses
code snippets from another example,
[Image classification with Vision Transformer](https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/).

## The CCT tokenizer

The first recipe introduced by the CCT authors is the tokenizer for processing the
images. In a standard ViT, images are organized into uniform *non-overlapping* patches.
This eliminates the boundary-level information present in between different patches. This
is important for a neural network to effectively exploit the locality information. The
figure below presents an illustration of how images are organized into patches.

We already know that convolutions are quite good at exploiting locality information. So,
based on this, the authors introduce an all-convolution mini-network to produce image
patches.

## Stochastic depth for regularization

[Stochastic depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382) is a regularization technique that
randomly drops a set of layers. During inference, the layers are kept as they are. It is
very much similar to [Dropout](https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html) but only
that it operates on a block of layers rather than individual nodes present inside a
layer. In CCT, stochastic depth is used just before the residual blocks of a Transformers
encoder.

The CCT model we just trained has just **0.4 million** parameters, and it gets us to
~78% top-1 accuracy within 30 epochs. The plot above shows no signs of overfitting as
well. This means we can train this network for longer (perhaps with a bit more
regularization) and may obtain even better performance. This performance can further be
improved by additional recipes like cosine decay learning rate schedule, other data augmentation
techniques like [AutoAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501),
[MixUp](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) or
[Cutmix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899). With these modifications, the authors present
95.1% top-1 accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The authors also present a number of
experiments to study how the number of convolution blocks, Transformers layers, etc.
affect the final performance of CCTs.

For a comparison, a ViT model takes about **4.7 million** parameters and **100
epochs** of training to reach a top-1 accuracy of 78.22% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. You can

The authors also demonstrate the performance of Compact Convolutional Transformers on
NLP tasks and they report competitive results there.
