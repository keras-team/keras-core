"""
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an interesting branch of study in the field of
representation learning. SSL systems try to formulate a supervised signal from a corpus
of unlabeled data points.  An example is we train a deep neural network to predict the
next word from a given set of words. In literature, these tasks are known as *pretext
tasks* or *auxiliary tasks*. If we [train such a network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) on a huge dataset (such as
the [Wikipedia text corpus](https://www.corpusdata.org/wikipedia.asp)) it learns very effective
representations that transfer well to downstream tasks. Language models like
[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165),
[ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo) all benefit from this.

Much like the language models we can train computer vision models using similar
approaches. To make things work in computer vision, we need to formulate the learning
tasks such that the underlying model (a deep neural network) is able to make sense of the
semantic information present in vision data. One such task is to a model to _contrast_
between two different versions of the same image. The hope is that in this way the model
will have learn representations where the similar images are grouped as together possible
while the dissimilar images are further away.

In this example, we will be implementing one such system called **SimSiam** proposed in
[Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566). It
is implemented as the following:

1. We create two different versions of the same dataset with a stochastic data
augmentation pipeline. Note that the random initialization seed needs to be the same
during create these versions.
2. We take a ResNet without any classification head (**backbone**) and we add a shallow
fully-connected network (**projection head**) on top of it. Collectively, this is known
as the **encoder**.
3. We pass the output of the encoder through a **predictor** which is again a shallow
fully-connected network having an
[AutoEncoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) like structure.
4. We then train our encoder to maximize the cosine similarity between the two different
versions of our dataset.

## Defining our data augmentation pipeline

As studied in [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) having the right data
augmentation pipeline is critical for SSL systems to work effectively in computer vision.
Two particular augmentation transforms that seem to matter the most are: 1.) Random
resized crops and 2.) Color distortions. Most of the other SSL systems for computer
vision (such as [BYOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733),
[MoCoV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297), [SwAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882),
etc.) include these in their training pipelines.

It should be noted that an augmentation pipeline is generally dependent on various

heavily object-centric then taking random crops with a very high probability may hurt the
training performance.

If your solution gets very close to -1 (minimum value of our loss) very quickly with a
different dataset and a different backbone architecture that is likely because of

* Learning rate and its schedule.

## Evaluating our SSL method

The most popularly used method to evaluate a SSL method in computer vision (or any other
pre-training method as such) is to learn a linear classifier on the frozen features of
the trained backbone model (in this case it is ResNet20) and evaluate the classifier on
unseen images. Other methods include
[fine-tuning](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/) on the source dataset or even a
target dataset with 5% or 10% labels present. Practically, we can use the backbone model
for any downstream task such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and so on where
the backbone models are usually pre-trained with *pure supervised learning*.

## Notes
* More data and longer pre-training schedule benefit SSL in general.
* SSL is particularly very helpful when you do not have access to very limited *labeled*
training data but you can manage to build a large corpus of unlabeled data. Recently,
using an SSL method called [SwAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882), a group of
researchers at Facebook trained a [RegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882) on 2 Billion
images. They were able to achieve downstream performance very close to those achieved by
pure supervised pre-training. For some downstream tasks, their method even outperformed
the supervised counterparts. You can check out [their
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01988.pdf) to know the details.
