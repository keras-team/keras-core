## Overview

Metric learning aims to train models that can embed inputs into a high-dimensional space
such that "similar" inputs, as defined by the training scheme, are located close to each
other. These models once trained can produce embeddings for downstream systems where such
similarity is useful; examples include as a ranking signal for search or as a form of
pretrained embedding model for another supervised problem.

"""
Metric learning provides training data not as explicit `(X, y)` pairs but instead uses
multiple instances that are related in the way we want to express similarity. In our
example we will use instances of the same class to represent similarity; a single
training instance will not be one image, but a pair of images of the same class. When
referring to the images in this pair we'll use the common metric learning names of the
`anchor` (a randomly chosen image) and the `positive` (another randomly chosen image of
the same class).

To facilitate this we need to build a form of lookup that maps from classes to the
instances of that class. When generating data for training we will sample from this
lookup.

"""
For this example we are using the simplest approach to training; a batch will consist of
`(anchor, positive)` pairs spread across the classes. The goal of learning will be to
move the anchor and positive pairs closer together and further away from other instances
in the batch. In this case the batch size will be dictated by the number of classes; for
CIFAR-10 this is 10.

Next we describe the architecture that maps from an image to an embedding. This model
simply consists of a sequence of 2d convolutions followed by global pooling with a final
linear projection to an embedding space. As is common in metric learning we normalise the
embeddings so that we can use simple dot products to measure similarity. For simplicity
this model is intentionally small.

class?

We observe that each animal class does generally well, and is confused the most with the
other animal classes. The vehicle classes follow the same pattern.
