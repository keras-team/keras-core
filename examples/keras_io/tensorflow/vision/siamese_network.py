## Introduction

A [Siamese Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network) is a type of network architecture that
contains two or more identical subnetworks used to generate feature vectors for each input and compare them.

Siamese Networks can be applied to different use cases, like detecting duplicates, finding anomalies, and face recognition.

This example uses a Siamese Network with three identical subnetworks. We will provide three images to the model, where
two of them will be similar (_anchor_ and _positive_ samples), and the third will be unrelated (a _negative_ example.)
Our goal is for the model to learn to estimate the similarity between images.

For the network to learn, we use a triplet loss function. You can find an introduction to triplet loss in the
[FaceNet paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) by Schroff et al,. 2015. In this example, we define the triplet
loss function as follows:

`L(A, P, N) = max(‖f(A) - f(P)‖² - ‖f(A) - f(N)‖² + margin, 0)`

This example uses the [Totally Looks Like dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/totally-looks-like-dataset)
by [Rosenfeld et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01485v3.pdf).

Our Siamese Network will generate embeddings for each of the images of the

embeddings.

We will freeze the weights of all the layers of the model up until the layer `conv5_block1_out`.
This is important to avoid affecting the weights that the model has already learned.
We are going to leave the bottom few layers trainable, so that we can fine-tune their weights
during training.

## Summary

1. The `tf.data` API enables you to build efficient input pipelines for your model. It is
particularly useful if you have a large dataset. You can learn more about `tf.data`
pipelines in [tf.data: Build TensorFlow input pipelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data).

2. In this example, we use a pre-trained ResNet50 as part of the subnetwork that generates
the feature embeddings. By using [transfer learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/transfer_learning?hl=en),
we can significantly reduce the training time and size of the dataset.

3. Notice how we are [fine-tuning](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/transfer_learning?hl=en#fine-tuning)
the weights of the final layers of the ResNet50 network but keeping the rest of the layers untouched.
Using the name assigned to each layer, we can freeze the weights to a certain point and keep the last few layers open.

4. We can create custom layers by creating a class that inherits from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`,
as we did in the `DistanceLayer` class.

5. We used a cosine similarity metric to measure how to 2 output embeddings are similar to each other.

6. You can implement a custom training loop by overriding the `train_step()` method. `train_step()` uses
[`tf.GradientTape`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/GradientTape),
which records every operation that you perform inside it. In this example, we use it to access the
gradients passed to the optimizer to update the model weights at every step. For more details, check out the
[Intro to Keras for researchers](https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_researchers/)
and [Writing a training loop from scratch](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/writing_a_training_loop_from_scratch?hl=en).
