## Introduction

BigTransfer (also known as BiT) is a state-of-the-art transfer learning method for image
classification. Transfer of pre-trained representations improves sample efficiency and
simplifies hyperparameter tuning when training deep neural networks for vision. BiT
revisit the paradigm of pre-training on large supervised datasets and fine-tuning the
model on a target task. The importance of appropriately choosing normalization layers and
scaling the architecture capacity as the amount of pre-training data increases.

BigTransfer(BiT) is trained on public datasets, along with code in
[TF2, Jax and Pytorch](https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer). This will help anyone to reach
state of the art performance on their task of interest, even with just a handful of
labeled images per class.

You can find BiT models pre-trained on
[ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index) and ImageNet-21k in
[TFHub](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bit/1) as TensorFlow2 SavedModels that you
can use easily as Keras Layers. There are a variety of sizes ranging from a standard
ResNet50 to a ResNet152x4 (152 layers deep, 4x wider than a typical ResNet50) for users
with larger computational and memory budgets but higher accuracy requirements.

Figure: The x-axis shows the number of images used per class, ranging from 1 to the full
dataset. On the plots on the left, the curve in blue above is our BiT-L model, whereas
the curve below is a ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet (ILSVRC-2012).

The hyperparamteres like `SCHEDULE_LENGTH` and `SCHEDULE_BOUNDARIES` are determined based
on empirical results. The method has been explained in the [original
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370) and in their [Google AI Blog
Post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/open-sourcing-bit-exploring-large-scale.html).

The `SCHEDULE_LENGTH` is aslo determined whether to use [MixUp
Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) or not. You can also find an easy MixUp
Implementation in [Keras Coding Examples](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mixup/).

## Create BigTransfer (BiT) model

To create the new model, we:

1. Cut off the BiT model’s original head. This leaves us with the “pre-logits” output.
We do not have to do this if we use the ‘feature extractor’ models (i.e. all those in
subdirectories titled `feature_vectors`), since for those models the head has already
been cut off.

2. Add a new head with the number of outputs equal to the number of classes of our new
task. Note that it is important that we initialise the head to all zeroes.

## Conclusion

BiT performs well across a surprisingly wide range of data regimes
-- from 1 example per class to 1M total examples. BiT achieves 87.5% top-1 accuracy on
ILSVRC-2012, 99.4% on CIFAR-10, and 76.3% on the 19 task Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark
(VTAB). On small datasets, BiT attains 76.8% on ILSVRC-2012 with 10 examples per class,
and 97.0% on CIFAR-10 with 10 examples per class.
