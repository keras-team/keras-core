## Introduction
"""

"""
_mixup_ is a *domain-agnostic* data augmentation technique proposed in [mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412)
by Zhang et al. It's implemented with the following formulas:

![](https://i.ibb.co/DRyHYww/image.png)

(Note that the lambda values are values with the [0, 1] range and are sampled from the
[Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution).)

The technique is quite systematically named. We are literally mixing up the features and
their corresponding labels. Implementation-wise it's simple. Neural networks are prone
to [memorizing corrupt labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530). mixup relaxes this by
combining different features with one another (same happens for the labels too) so that
a network does not get overconfident about the relationship between the features and
their labels.

mixup is specifically useful when we are not sure about selecting a set of augmentation
transforms for a given dataset, medical imaging datasets, for example. mixup can be
extended to a variety of data modalities such as computer vision, naturallanguage
processing, speech, and so on.

## Prepare the dataset

In this example, we will be using the [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset. But this same recipe can
be used for other classification datasets as well.

## Define the mixup technique function

To perform the mixup routine, we create new virtual datasets using the training data from
the same dataset, and apply a lambda value within the [0, 1] range sampled from a [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution)
— such that, for example, `new_x = lambda * x1 + (1 - lambda) * x2` (where
`x1` and `x2` are images) and the same equation is applied to the labels as well.

Readers are encouraged to try out mixup on different datasets from different domains and
experiment with the lambda parameter. You are strongly advised to check out the
[original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) as well - the authors present several ablation studies on mixup
showing how it can improve generalization, as well as show their results of combining
more than two images to create a single one.
"""

"""
## Notes

* With mixup, you can create synthetic examples — especially when you lack a large
dataset - without incurring high computational costs.
* [Label smoothing](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/12/30/label-smoothing-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) and mixup usually do not work well together because label smoothing
already modifies the hard labels by some factor.
* mixup does not work well when you are using [Supervised Contrastive
Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362) (SCL) since SCL expects the true labels
during its pre-training phase.
* A few other benefits of mixup include (as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412)) robustness to
adversarial examples and stabilized GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) training.
* There are a number of data augmentation techniques that extend mixup such as
[CutMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899) and [AugMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02781).
