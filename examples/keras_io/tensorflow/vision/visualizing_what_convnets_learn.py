## Introduction

In this example, we look into what sort of visual patterns image classification models
learn. We'll be using the `ResNet50V2` model, trained on the ImageNet dataset.

Our process is simple: we will create input images that maximize the activation of
specific filters in a target layer (picked somewhere in the middle of the model: layer
`conv3_block4_out`). Such images represent a visualization of the
pattern that the filter responds to.
"""

"""
## Setup
"""

import os

os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "tensorflow"

import keras_core as keras


import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# The dimensions of our input image
img_width = 180
img_height = 180
# Our target layer: we will visualize the filters from this layer.
# See `model.summary()` for list of layer names, if you want to change this.
layer_name = "conv3_block4_out"

"""
## Build a feature extraction model
"""

# Build a ResNet50V2 model loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights
model = keras.applications.ResNet50V2(weights="imagenet", include_top=False)

# Set up a model that returns the activation values for our target layer
layer = model.get_layer(name=layer_name)
feature_extractor = keras.Model(inputs=model.inputs, outputs=layer.output)

"""
## Set up the gradient ascent process

The "loss" we will maximize is simply the mean of the activation of a specific filter in
our target layer. To avoid border effects, we exclude border pixels.
"""


def compute_loss(input_image, filter_index):
    activation = feature_extractor(input_image)
    # We avoid border artifacts by only involving non-border pixels in the loss.
    filter_activation = activation[:, 2:-2, 2:-2, filter_index]
    return tf.reduce_mean(filter_activation)


"""
Our gradient ascent function simply computes the gradients of the loss above
with regard to the input image, and update the update image so as to move it
towards a state that will activate the target filter more strongly.
"""

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(img)

    # Compute gradients.
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, img)
    # Normalize gradients.
    grads = tf.math.l2_normalize(grads)
    img += learning_rate * grads
    return loss, img


"""
## Set up the end-to-end filter visualization loop

Our process is as follow:

- Start from a random image that is close to "all gray" (i.e. visually netural)
- Repeatedly apply the gradient ascent step function defined above
- Convert the resulting input image back to a displayable form, by normalizing it,
center-cropping it, and restricting it to the [0, 255] range.

    # Here we scale our random inputs to [-0.125, +0.125]

Let's try it out with filter 0 in the target layer:

This is what an input that maximizes the response of filter 0 in the target layer would
look like:

## Visualize the first 64 filters in the target layer

Now, let's make a 8x8 grid of the first 64 filters
