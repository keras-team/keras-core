## Introduction

It is a common practice to use the same input image resolution while training and testing
vision models. However, as investigated in
[Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06423)
(Touvron et al.), this practice leads to suboptimal performance. Data augmentation
is an indispensable part of the training process of deep neural networks. For vision models, we
typically use random resized crops during training and center crops during inference.
This introduces a discrepancy in the object sizes seen during training and inference.
As shown by Touvron et al., if we can fix this discrepancy, we can significantly
boost model performance.

In this example, we implement the **FixRes** techniques introduced by Touvron et al.
to fix this discrepancy.

## Data preprocessing utilities

"""
We create three datasets:

1. A dataset with a smaller resolution - 128x128.
2. Two datasets with a larger resolution - 224x224.

We will apply different augmentation transforms to the larger-resolution datasets.

The idea of FixRes is to first train a model on a smaller resolution dataset and then fine-tune
it on a larger resolution dataset. This simple yet effective recipe leads to non-trivial performance
improvements. Please refer to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06423) for
results.

As we can notice from the above cells, FixRes leads to a better performance. Another
advantage of FixRes is the improved total training time and reduction in GPU memory usage.
FixRes is model-agnostic, you can use it on any image classification model
to potentially boost performance.

You can find more results
[here](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/BQOg28w0TlmvuJYeqsVntw)
that were gathered by running the same code with different random seeds.
