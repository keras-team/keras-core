Accelerator: GPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

This example provides an implementation of the
[Deep Neural Decision Forest](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7410529)
model introduced by P. Kontschieder et al. for structured data classification.
It demonstrates how to build a stochastic and differentiable decision tree model,
train it end-to-end, and unify decision trees with deep representation learning.

## The dataset

This example uses the
[United States Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income)
provided by the
[UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
The task is binary classification
to predict whether a person is likely to be making over USD 50,000 a year.

The dataset includes 48,842 instances with 14 input features (such as age, work class, education, occupation, and so on): 5 numerical features
and 9 categorical features.

## Deep Neural Decision Tree

A neural decision tree model has two sets of weights to learn. The first set is `pi`,
which represents the probability distribution of the classes in the tree leaves.
The second set is the weights of the routing layer `decision_fn`, which represents the probability
of going to each leave. The forward pass of the model works as follows:

1. The model expects input `features` as a single vector encoding all the features of an instance
in the batch. This vector can be generated from a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) applied to images
or dense transformations applied to structured data features.
2. The model first applies a `used_features_mask` to randomly select a subset of input features to use.
3. Then, the model computes the probabilities (`mu`) for the input instances to reach the tree leaves
by iteratively performing a *stochastic* routing throughout the tree levels.
4. Finally, the probabilities of reaching the leaves are combined by the class probabilities at the
leaves to produce the final `outputs`.
