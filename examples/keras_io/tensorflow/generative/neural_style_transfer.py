## Introduction

Style transfer consists in generating an image
with the same "content" as a base image, but with the
"style" of a different picture (typically artistic).
This is achieved through the optimization of a loss function
that has 3 components: "style loss", "content loss",
and "total variation loss":

- The total variation loss imposes local spatial continuity between
the pixels of the combination image, giving it visual coherence.
- The style loss is where the deep learning keeps in --that one is defined
using a deep convolutional neural network. Precisely, it consists in a sum of
L2 distances between the Gram matrices of the representations of
the base image and the style reference image, extracted from
different layers of a convnet (trained on ImageNet). The general idea
is to capture color/texture information at different spatial
scales (fairly large scales --defined by the depth of the layer considered).
- The content loss is a L2 distance between the features of the base
image (extracted from a deep layer) and the features of the combination image,
keeping the generated image close enough to the original one.

## Compute the style transfer loss

First, we need to define 4 utility functions:

- `gram_matrix` (used to compute the style loss)
- The `style_loss` function, which keeps the generated image close to the local textures
of the style reference image
- The `content_loss` function, which keeps the high-level representation of the
generated image close to that of the base image
- The `total_variation_loss` function, a regularization loss which keeps the generated
image locally-coherent
