## Introduction

"Deep dream" is an image-filtering technique which consists of taking an image
classification model, and running gradient ascent over an input image to
try to maximize the activations of specific layers (and sometimes, specific units in
specific layers) for this input. It produces hallucination-like visuals.

It was first introduced by Alexander Mordvintsev from Google in July 2015.

Process:

- Load the original image.
- Define a number of processing scales ("octaves"),
from smallest to largest.
- Resize the original image to the smallest scale.
- For every scale, starting with the smallest (i.e. current one):
    - Run gradient ascent
    - Upscale image to the next scale
    - Reinject the detail that was lost at upscaling time
- Stop when we are back to the original size.
To obtain the detail lost during upscaling, we simply
take the original image, shrink it down, upscale it,
and compare the result to the (resized) original image.

Let's set up some image preprocessing/deprocessing utilities:

    # into appropriate arrays.
    img = keras.utils.load_img(image_path)
    img = keras.utils.img_to_array(img)
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    img = inception_v3.preprocess_input(img)
    return img


def deprocess_image(x):
    # Util function to convert a NumPy array into a valid image.
    x = x.reshape((x.shape[1], x.shape[2], 3))
    # Undo inception v3 preprocessing
    x /= 2.0
    x += 0.5
    x *= 255.0
    # Convert to uint8 and clip to the valid range [0, 255]
    x = np.clip(x, 0, 255).astype("uint8")
    return x

First, build a feature extraction model to retrieve the activations of our target layers
given an input image.
