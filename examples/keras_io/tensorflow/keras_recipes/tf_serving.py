## Introduction

Once you build a machine learning model, the next step is to serve it.
You may want to do that by exposing your model as an endpoint service.
There are many frameworks that you can use to do that, but the TensorFlow
ecosystem has its own solution called
[TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving).

From the TensorFlow Serving
[GitHub page](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving):

> TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine
learning models, designed for production environments. It deals with the
inference aspect of machine learning, taking models after training and
managing their lifetimes, providing clients with versioned access via a
high-performance, reference-counted lookup table. TensorFlow Serving provides
out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended
to serve other types of models and data."

To note a few features:

- It can serve multiple models, or multiple versions of the same model
simultaneously
- It exposes both gRPC as well as HTTP inference endpoints
- It allows deployment of new model versions without changing any client code
- It supports canarying new versions and A/B testing experimental models
- It adds minimal latency to inference time due to efficient, low-overhead
implementation
- It features a scheduler that groups individual inference requests into batches
for joint execution on GPU, with configurable latency controls
- It supports many servables: Tensorflow models, embeddings, vocabularies,
feature transformations and even non-Tensorflow-based machine learning models

This guide creates a simple [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)
model using the [Keras applications API](https://keras.io/api/applications/),
and then serves it with [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving).
The focus is on TensorFlow Serving, rather than the modeling and training in
TensorFlow.

> Note: you can find a Colab notebook with the full working code at
[this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nwuIJa4so1XzYU0ngq8tX_-SGTO295Mu?usp=sharing).

## Dependencies

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

"""
## Model

Here we load a pre-trained [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)
from the [Keras applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/), this is the
model that we are going to serve.
"""

model = keras.applications.MobileNet()

"""
## Preprocessing

Most models don't work out of the box on raw data, they usually require some
kind of preprocessing step to adjust the data to the model requirements,
in the case of this MobileNet we can see from its
[API page](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/) that it requires
three basic steps for its input images:

- Pixel values normalized to the `[0, 1]` range
- Pixel values scaled to the `[-1, 1]` range
- Images with the shape of `(224, 224, 3)` meaning `(height, width, channels)`

We can do all of that with the following function:
"""


def preprocess(image, mean=0.5, std=0.5, shape=(224, 224)):
    """Scale, normalize and resizes images."""
    image = image / 255.0  # Scale
    image = (image - mean) / std  # Normalize
    image = tf.image.resize(image, shape)  # Resize
    return image


"""
**A note regarding preprocessing and postprocessing using the "keras.applications" API**

All models that are available at the [Keras applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/)
API also provide `preprocess_input` and `decode_predictions` functions, those
functions are respectively responsible for the preprocessing and postprocessing
of each model, and already contains all the logic necessary for those steps.
That is the recommended way to process inputs and outputs when using Keras
applications models.
For this guide, we are not using them to present the advantages of custom
signatures in a clearer way.
"""


"""
## Postprocessing

In the same context most models output values that need extra processing to
meet the user requirements, for instance, the user does not want to know the
logits values for each class given an image, what the user wants is to know
from which class it belongs. For our model, this translates to the following
transformations on top of the model outputs:

- Get the index of the class with the highest prediction
- Get the name of the class from that index

    """Convert from probs to labels."""
    indices = tf.argmax(prediction, axis=-1)  # Index with highest prediction

model_outputs = model(batched_img)
print(f"Model output shape: {model_outputs.shape}")
print(f"Predicted class: {postprocess(model_outputs)}")

"""
## Save the model

To load our trained model into TensorFlow Serving, we first need to save it in
[SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model)
format. This will create a protobuf file in a well-defined directory hierarchy,
and will include a version number.
[TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) allows us
to select which version of a model, or "servable" we want to use when we make
inference requests. Each version will be exported to a different sub-directory
under the given path.
"""

model_dir = "./model"
model_version = 1
model_export_path = f"{model_dir}/{model_version}"

tf.saved_model.save(
    model,
    export_dir=model_export_path,
)

print(f"SavedModel files: {os.listdir(model_export_path)}")

"""
## Examine your saved model

We'll use the command line utility `saved_model_cli` to look at the
[MetaGraphDefs](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/MetaGraphDef)
(the models) and [SignatureDefs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/signature_defs)
(the methods you can call) in our SavedModel. See
[this discussion of the SavedModel CLI](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/guide/saved_model.md#cli-to-inspect-and-execute-savedmodel)
in the TensorFlow Guide.
"""


"""shell
saved_model_cli show --dir {model_export_path} --tag_set serve --signature_def serving_default
"""

"""
That tells us a lot about our model! For instance, we can see that its inputs
have a 4D shape `(-1, 224, 224, 3)` which means
`(batch_size, height, width, channels)`, also note that this model requires a
specific image shape `(224, 224, 3)` this means that we may need to reshape
our images before sending them to the model. We can also see that the model's
outputs have a `(-1, 1000)` shape which are the logits for the 1000 classes of
the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org) dataset.

This information doesn't tell us everything, like the fact that the pixel
values needs to be in the `[-1, 1]` range, but it's a great start.

## Serve your model with TensorFlow Serving

### Install TFServing

We're preparing to install TensorFlow Serving using
[Aptitude](https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude) since this Colab runs in a Debian
environment. We'll add the `tensorflow-model-server` package to the list of
packages that Aptitude knows about. Note that we're running as root.


> Note: This example is running TensorFlow Serving natively, but [you can also
run it in a Docker container](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/docker),
which is one of the easiest ways to get started using TensorFlow Serving.

```shell
wget 'http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-serving-apt/pool/tensorflow-model-server-universal-2.8.0/t/tensorflow-model-server-universal/tensorflow-model-server-universal_2.8.0_all.deb'
dpkg -i tensorflow-model-server-universal_2.8.0_all.deb
```
"""

"""
### Start running TensorFlow Serving

This is where we start running TensorFlow Serving and load our model. After it
loads, we can start making inference requests using REST. There are some
important parameters:

- `port`: The port that you'll use for gRPC requests.
- `rest_api_port`: The port that you'll use for REST requests.
- `model_name`: You'll use this in the URL of REST requests. It can be
anything.
- `model_base_path`: This is the path to the directory where you've saved your
model.

Check the [TFServing API reference](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/model_servers/main.cc)
to get all the parameters available.

## Make a request to your model in TensorFlow Serving

Now let's create the JSON object for an inference request, and see how well
our model classifies it:

### REST API

#### Newest version of the servable

We'll send a predict request as a POST to our server's REST endpoint, and pass
it as an example. We'll ask our server to give us the latest version of our
servable by not specifying a particular version.

    {
        "signature_name": "serving_default",
        "instances": batched_img.numpy().tolist(),
    }
)
url = "http://localhost:8501/v1/models/model:predict"


def predict_rest(json_data, url):
    json_response = requests.post(url, data=json_data)
    response = json.loads(json_response.text)
    rest_outputs = np.array(response["predictions"])
    return rest_outputs


"""
```python
rest_outputs = predict_rest(data, url)

print(f"REST output shape: {rest_outputs.shape}")
print(f"Predicted class: {postprocess(rest_outputs)}")
```

outputs:
```
REST output shape: (1, 1000)
Predicted class: [b'banana']
```

### gRPC API

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model and
is a technology for implementing RPC APIs that uses HTTP 2.0 as its underlying
transport protocol. gRPC is usually preferred for low-latency, highly scalable,
and distributed systems. If you wanna know more about the REST vs gRPC
tradeoffs, checkout
[this article](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/understanding-grpc-openapi-and-rest-and-when-to-use-them).

"""
## Custom signature

Note that for this model we always need to preprocess and postprocess all
samples to get the desired output, this can get quite tricky if are
maintaining and serving several models developed by a large team, and each one
of them might require different processing logic.

TensorFlow allows us to customize the model graph to embed all of that
processing logic, which makes model serving much easier, there are different
ways to achieve this, but since we are going to server the models using
TFServing we can customize the model graph straight into the serving signature.

We can just use the following code to export the same model that already
contains the preprocessing and postprocessing logic as the default signature,
this allows this model to make predictions on raw data.

outputs the 1000-long logits.

## Prediction using a particular version of the servable

Now let's specify a particular version of our servable. Note that when we
saved the model with a custom signature we used a different folder, the first
model was saved in folder `/1` (version 1), and the one with a custom
signature in folder `/2` (version 2). By default, TFServing will serve all
models that share the same base parent folder.
