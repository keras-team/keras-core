## Introduction

Vision Transformers (ViT; [Dosovitskiy et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)) extract
small patches from the input images, linearly project them, and then apply the
Transformer ([Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) blocks. The application
of ViTs to image recognition tasks is quickly becoming a promising area of research,
because ViTs eliminate the need to have strong inductive biases (such as convolutions) for
modeling locality. This presents them as a general computation primititive capable of
learning just from the training data with as minimal inductive priors as possible. ViTs
yield great downstream performance when trained with proper regularization, data
augmentation, and relatively large datasets.

In the [Patches Are All You Need](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TVHS5Y4dNvM) paper (note: at
the time of writing, it is a submission to the ICLR 2022 conference), the authors extend
the idea of using patches to train an all-convolutional network and demonstrate
competitive results. Their architecture namely **ConvMixer** uses recipes from the recent
isotrophic architectures like ViT, MLP-Mixer
([Tolstikhin et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601)), such as using the same
depth and resolution across different layers in the network, residual connections,
and so on.

In this example, we will implement the ConvMixer model and demonstrate its performance on
the CIFAR-10 dataset.

the core ideas of ConvMixer, we will not use other training-specific elements like
RandAugment ([Cubuk et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719)). If you are interested in

## ConvMixer utilities

The following figure (taken from the original paper) depicts the ConvMixer model:

![](https://i.imgur.com/yF8actg.png)

ConvMixer is very similar to the MLP-Mixer, model with the following key
differences:

* Instead of using fully-connected layers, it uses standard convolution layers.
* Instead of LayerNorm (which is typical for ViTs and MLP-Mixers), it uses BatchNorm.

Two types of convolution layers are used in ConvMixer. **(1)**: Depthwise convolutions,
for mixing spatial locations of the images, **(2)**: Pointwise convolutions (which follow
the depthwise convolutions), for mixing channel-wise information across the patches.
Another keypoint is the use of *larger kernel sizes* to allow a larger receptive field.

## Final notes

There's been a recent trend on fusing convolutions with other data-agnostic operations
like self-attention. Following works are along this line of research:

* ConViT ([d'Ascoli et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10697))
* CCT ([Hassani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704))
* CoAtNet ([Dai et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04803))
