    Supported image formats: `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.gif`.
    Animated gifs are truncated to the first frame.

    Args:
        directory: Directory where the data is located.
            If `labels` is `"inferred"`, it should contain
            subdirectories, each containing images for a class.
            Otherwise, the directory structure is ignored.
        labels: Either `"inferred"`
            (labels are generated from the directory structure),
            `None` (no labels),
            or a list/tuple of integer labels of the same size as the number of
            image files found in the directory. Labels should be sorted
            according to the alphanumeric order of the image file paths
            (obtained via `os.walk(directory)` in Python).
        label_mode: String describing the encoding of `labels`. Options are:
            - `"int"`: means that the labels are encoded as integers
                (e.g. for `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss).
            - `"categorical"` means that the labels are
                encoded as a categorical vector
                (e.g. for `categorical_crossentropy` loss).
            - `"binary"` means that the labels (there can be only 2)
                are encoded as `float32` scalars with values 0 or 1
                (e.g. for `binary_crossentropy`).
            - `None` (no labels).
        class_names: Only valid if `labels` is `"inferred"`.
            This is the explicit list of class names
            (must match names of subdirectories). Used to control the order
            of the classes (otherwise alphanumerical order is used).
        color_mode: One of `"grayscale"`, `"rgb"`, `"rgba"`.
            Defaults to `"rgb"`. Whether the images will be converted to
            have 1, 3, or 4 channels.
        batch_size: Size of the batches of data. Defaults to 32.
            If `None`, the data will not be batched
            (the dataset will yield individual samples).
        image_size: Size to resize images to after they are read from disk,
            specified as `(height, width)`. Defaults to `(256, 256)`.
            Since the pipeline processes batches of images that must all have
            the same size, this must be provided.
        shuffle: Whether to shuffle the data. Defaults to `True`.
            If set to `False`, sorts the data in alphanumeric order.
        seed: Optional random seed for shuffling and transformations.
        validation_split: Optional float between 0 and 1,
            fraction of data to reserve for validation.
        subset: Subset of the data to return.
            One of `"training"`, `"validation"`, or `"both"`.
            Only used if `validation_split` is set.
            When `subset="both"`, the utility returns a tuple of two datasets
            (the training and validation datasets respectively).
        interpolation: String, the interpolation method used when
            resizing images. Defaults to `"bilinear"`.
            Supports `"bilinear"`, `"nearest"`, `"bicubic"`, `"area"`,
            `"lanczos3"`, `"lanczos5"`, `"gaussian"`, `"mitchellcubic"`.
        follow_links: Whether to visit subdirectories pointed to by symlinks.
            Defaults to `False`.
        crop_to_aspect_ratio: If `True`, resize the images without aspect
            ratio distortion. When the original aspect ratio differs from the
            target aspect ratio, the output image will be cropped so as to
            return the largest possible window in the image
            (of size `image_size`) that matches the target aspect ratio. By
            default (`crop_to_aspect_ratio=False`), aspect ratio may not be
            preserved.

    Returns:

    A `tf.data.Dataset` object.

    - If `label_mode` is `None`, it yields `float32` tensors of shape
        `(batch_size, image_size[0], image_size[1], num_channels)`,
        encoding images (see below for rules regarding `num_channels`).
    - Otherwise, it yields a tuple `(images, labels)`, where `images` has
        shape `(batch_size, image_size[0], image_size[1], num_channels)`,
        and `labels` follows the format described below.

    Rules regarding labels format:

        `(batch_size,)`.
    - if `label_mode` is `"binary"`, the labels are a `float32` tensor of

        of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`, representing a one-hot
        encoding of the class index.

    Rules regarding number of channels in the yielded images:

    - if `color_mode` is `"grayscale"`,
        there's 1 channel in the image tensors.
    - if `color_mode` is `"rgb"`,
        there are 3 channels in the image tensors.
    - if `color_mode` is `"rgba"`,
        there are 4 channels in the image tensors.

    equal intervals, along with time series parameters such as
    length of the sequences/windows, spacing between two sequence/windows, etc.,
    to produce batches of timeseries inputs and targets.

    Args:
        data: Numpy array or eager tensor
            containing consecutive data points (timesteps).
            Axis 0 is expected to be the time dimension.
        targets: Targets corresponding to timesteps in `data`.
            `targets[i]` should be the target
            corresponding to the window that starts at index `i`
            (see example 2 below).
            Pass `None` if you don't have target data (in this case the dataset
            will only yield the input data).
        sequence_length: Length of the output sequences
            (in number of timesteps).
        sequence_stride: Period between successive output sequences.
            For stride `s`, output samples would
            start at index `data[i]`, `data[i + s]`, `data[i + 2 * s]`, etc.
        sampling_rate: Period between successive individual timesteps
            within sequences. For rate `r`, timesteps
            `data[i], data[i + r], ... data[i + sequence_length]`
            are used for creating a sample sequence.
        batch_size: Number of timeseries samples in each batch
            (except maybe the last one). If `None`, the data will not be batched
            (the dataset will yield individual samples).
        shuffle: Whether to shuffle output samples,
            or instead draw them in chronological order.
        seed: Optional int; random seed for shuffling.
        start_index: Optional int; data points earlier (exclusive)
            than `start_index` will not be used
            in the output sequences. This is useful to reserve part of the
            data for test or validation.
        end_index: Optional int; data points later (exclusive) than `end_index`
            will not be used in the output sequences.
            This is useful to reserve part of the data for test or validation.

    Returns:

    A `tf.data.Dataset` instance. If `targets` was passed, the dataset yields
    tuple `(batch_of_sequences, batch_of_targets)`. If not, the dataset yields
    only `batch_of_sequences`.

    Example 1:

    Consider indices `[0, 1, ... 98]`.
    With `sequence_length=10,  sampling_rate=2, sequence_stride=3`,
    `shuffle=False`, the dataset will yield batches of sequences
    composed of the following indices:

    ```
    First sequence:  [0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18]
    Second sequence: [3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19 21]
    Third sequence:  [6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24]
    ...
    Last sequence:   [78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96]
    ```

    In this case the last 2 data points are discarded since no full sequence
    can be generated to include them (the next sequence would have started
    at index 81, and thus its last step would have gone over 98).

    Example 2: Temporal regression.

    Consider an array `data` of scalar values, of shape `(steps,)`.
    To generate a dataset that uses the past 10
    timesteps to predict the next timestep, you would use:

    ```python
    input_data = data[:-10]
    targets = data[10:]
    dataset = timeseries_dataset_from_array(
        input_data, targets, sequence_length=10)
    for batch in dataset:
      inputs, targets = batch
      assert np.array_equal(inputs[0], data[:10])  # First sequence: steps [0-9]
      # Corresponding target: step 10
      assert np.array_equal(targets[0], data[10])
      break
    ```

    Example 3: Temporal regression for many-to-many architectures.

    Consider two arrays of scalar values `X` and `Y`,
    both of shape `(100,)`. The resulting dataset should consist samples with
    20 timestamps each. The samples should not overlap.
    To generate a dataset that uses the current timestamp
    to predict the corresponding target timestep, you would use:

    ```python
    X = np.arange(100)
    Y = X*2

    sample_length = 20
    input_dataset = timeseries_dataset_from_array(
        X, None, sequence_length=sample_length, sequence_stride=sample_length)
    target_dataset = timeseries_dataset_from_array(
        Y, None, sequence_length=sample_length, sequence_stride=sample_length)

    for batch in zip(input_dataset, target_dataset):
        inputs, targets = batch
        assert np.array_equal(inputs[0], X[:sample_length])

        # second sample equals output timestamps 20-40
        assert np.array_equal(targets[1], Y[sample_length:2*sample_length])

            alphanumeric order of the audio file paths
            (obtained via `os.walk(directory)` in Python).
        label_mode: String describing the encoding of `labels`. Options are:
            - `"int"`: means that the labels are encoded as integers (e.g. for
              `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss).
            - `"categorical"` means that the labels are encoded as a categorical
              vector (e.g. for `categorical_crossentropy` loss)
            - `"binary"` means that the labels (there can be only 2)
              are encoded as `float32` scalars with values 0
              or 1 (e.g. for `binary_crossentropy`).
            - `None` (no labels).
        class_names: Only valid if "labels" is `"inferred"`.
            This is the explicit list of class names
            (must match names of subdirectories). Used to control the order
            of the classes (otherwise alphanumerical order is used).
        batch_size: Size of the batches of data. Default: 32. If `None`,
            the data will not be batched
            (the dataset will yield individual samples).
        sampling_rate: Audio sampling rate (in samples per second).
        output_sequence_length: Maximum length of an audio sequence. Audio files
            longer than this will be truncated to `output_sequence_length`.
            If set to `None`, then all sequences in the same batch will
            be padded to the
            length of the longest sequence in the batch.
        ragged: Whether to return a Ragged dataset (where each sequence has its
            own length). Defaults to `False`.
        shuffle: Whether to shuffle the data. Defaults to `True`.
            If set to `False`, sorts the data in alphanumeric order.
        seed: Optional random seed for shuffling and transformations.
        validation_split: Optional float between 0 and 1, fraction of data to
            reserve for validation.
        subset: Subset of the data to return. One of `"training"`,
            `"validation"` or `"both"`. Only used if `validation_split` is set.
        follow_links: Whether to visits subdirectories pointed to by symlinks.
            Defaults to `False`.

    Returns:

    A `tf.data.Dataset` object.

    - If `label_mode` is `None`, it yields `string` tensors of shape
      `(batch_size,)`, containing the contents of a batch of audio files.
    - Otherwise, it yields a tuple `(audio, labels)`, where `audio`
      has shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_channels)` and `labels`
      follows the format described
      below.

    Rules regarding labels format:

    - if `label_mode` is `int`, the labels are an `int32` tensor of shape
      `(batch_size,)`.
    - if `label_mode` is `binary`, the labels are a `float32` tensor of
      1s and 0s of shape `(batch_size, 1)`.
    - if `label_mode` is `categorical`, the labels are a `float32` tensor
      of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`, representing a one-hot
      encoding of the class index.
