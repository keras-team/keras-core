class RandomRotation(Layer):
    """A preprocessing layer which randomly rotates images during training.

    This layer will apply random rotations to each image, filling empty space
    according to `fill_mode`.

    By default, random rotations are only applied during training.
    At inference time, the layer does nothing. If you need to apply random
    rotations at inference time, set `training` to True when calling the layer.

    Input pixel values can be of any range (e.g. `[0., 1.)` or `[0, 255]`) and
    of integer or floating point dtype.
    By default, the layer will output floats.

    **Note:** This layer wraps `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`. It cannot
    be used as part of the compiled computation graph of a model with
    any backend other than TensorFlow.
    It can however be used with any backend when running eagerly.
    It can also always be used as part of an input preprocessing pipeline
    with any backend (outside the model itself), which is how we recommend
    to use this layer.

    Input shape:
        3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
        `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format

    Output shape:
        3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
        `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format

    Args:
        factor: a float represented as fraction of 2 Pi, or a tuple of size 2
            representing lower and upper bound for rotating clockwise and
            counter-clockwise. A positive values means rotating
            counter clock-wise,
            while a negative value means clock-wise.
            When represented as a single
            float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound.
            For instance, `factor=(-0.2, 0.3)`
            results in an output rotation by a random
            amount in the range `[-20% * 2pi, 30% * 2pi]`.
            `factor=0.2` results in an
            output rotating by a random amount
            in the range `[-20% * 2pi, 20% * 2pi]`.
        fill_mode: Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled
            according to the given mode
            (one of `{"constant", "reflect", "wrap", "nearest"}`).
            - *reflect*: `(d c b a | a b c d | d c b a)`
                The input is extended by reflecting about
                the edge of the last pixel.
            - *constant*: `(k k k k | a b c d | k k k k)`
                The input is extended by
                filling all values beyond the edge with
                the same constant value k = 0.
            - *wrap*: `(a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)` The input is extended by
                wrapping around to the opposite edge.
            - *nearest*: `(a a a a | a b c d | d d d d)`
                The input is extended by the nearest pixel.
        interpolation: Interpolation mode. Supported values: `"nearest"`,
            `"bilinear"`.
        seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
        fill_value: a float represents the value to be filled outside
            the boundaries when `fill_mode="constant"`.
