    This class is not a standalone RNN cell. It suppose to be used with a RNN
    cell by multiple inheritance. Any cell that mix with class should have
    following fields:

    - `dropout`: a float number in the range `[0, 1]`.
        Dropout rate for the input tensor.
    - `recurrent_dropout`: a float number in the range `[0, 1]`.
        Dropout rate for the recurrent connections.
    - `seed_generator`, an instance of `backend.random.SeedGenerator`.

    This object will create and cache dropout masks, and reuse them for
    all incoming steps, so that the same mask is used for every step.
